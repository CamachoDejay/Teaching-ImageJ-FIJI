# What do you find here

This is a collection of the material used for the NorMIC lab on image analysis. The google folder contains the data you will need to follow the lab. Moreover, I also provide links to the files in the detailed explanation below. The presentation used during the lab is found in the google slides. If you are completely new to FIJI, and don't know how to install the software please go to the end of this page for some useful links.

# Google folder

Here you can find the presentation in PDF and also the data we will be working on

## Google slides for day 1

[Link to the google ppt](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ic1tvGotdSsfa66PMfWprfFOx4ATRQpMvK5gVgvuik0/edit?usp=sharing)

Day 1, is a practical introduction to bio-image analysis in [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html) and [FIJI](https://imagej.net/Fiji). The material for the practical is a list of ImageJ/FIJI examples that illustrate:

1. Images are numbers
    * LUTs
    * Multidimensional data

2. Basic image analysis pipeline
    * Pre-processing: image filters
    * Segmentation
    * Post-processing: morphological operations
    * Quantification

### 1 Images are numbers

#### Before you begin

Download a fresh installation of [FIJI](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/).

Below you will find direct links to the files, which are in the training material [google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ASx1uBnLG7xr8hqTlWnkWvnNvj-uJ3sI?usp=sharing)

#### 1.1 Handling text files

### 2 Basic image analysis pipeline

Here the [demo rice image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wm-QEs4XcJ-cu42mStFtWK-QC7C5adQY/view?usp=sharing), a clasic!

If you are having problems with the sewgmentation, and want to practice the quantification tasks via "Analyze particles" please use this [segmented rice image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P8WEHL9ds0u2I4QPyu4KGqcB685B0HXu/view?usp=sharing) as a catchup
